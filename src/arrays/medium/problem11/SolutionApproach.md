--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Intuition**: By observation, we see that the first column of the original matrix is the reverse of the first row of the rotated matrix, so thatâ€™s why we transpose the matrix and then reverse each row, and since we are making changes in the matrix itself space complexity gets reduced to O(1).

**Approach:**

Step 1: Transpose the matrix. (transposing means changing columns to rows and rows to columns)

Step 2: Reverse each row of the matrix.
