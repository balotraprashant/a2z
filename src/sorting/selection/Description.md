# Selection Sort

The algorithm steps are as follows:

- First, we will select the range of the unsorted array using a loop (say i) that indicates the starting index of the range.
- The loop will run forward from 0 to n-1. The value i = 0 means the range is from 0 to n-1, and similarly, i = 1 means the range is from 1 to n-1, and so on.
(Initially, the range will be the whole array starting from the first index.)
- Now, in each iteration, we will select the minimum element from the range of the unsorted array using an inner loop.
- After that, we will swap the minimum element with the first element of the selected range(in step 1). 
- Finally, after each iteration, we will find that the array is sorted up to the first index of the range. 

**Note**: Here, after each iteration, the array becomes sorted up to the first index of the range. That is why the starting index of the range increases by 1 after each iteration. This increment is achieved by the outer loop and the starting index is represented by variable i in the following code. And the inner loop(i.e. j) helps to find the minimum element of the range [iâ€¦..n-1].

**Dry run:**

Assume the given array is: {7, 5, 9, 2, 8}

**Outer loop iteration 1**:

The range will be the whole array starting from the 1st index as this is the first iteration. The minimum element of this range is 2(found using the inner loop).
